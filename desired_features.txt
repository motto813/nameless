- If you delete yourself, either as a recruiter or an applicant, what happens to the dependent database entries?
    * Does it make sense to delete them right away?
    * Currently it crashes the program because the ActiveRecord associations are broken
- Authorizations... authorizations everywhere
- And authentications! (for applicants and recruiters)
- File upload capabilities
- Ability to scan a document for a name?  Would have to parse through the .PDF and search for common first/last names
- If you go to the hiring page from the looking page already logged in, should it automatically logout?
    * If so, should it display a message saying  as such?

    - full_name virtual attributes for applicants and recruiters
