- If you delete yourself, either as a recruiter or an applicant, what happens to the dependent database entries?
    * Does it make sense to delete them right away?
    * Currently it crashes the program because the ActiveRecord associations are broken
- Ability to scan a document for a name?  Would have to parse through the .PDF and search for common first/last names
- If you go to the hiring page from the looking page already logged in, should it automatically logout?
    * If so, should it display a message saying  as such?


- REFACTOR Stuff
  - authorized class methods are class agnostic for users...
  - Maybe could have a super class for User and have Applicant and Recruiter inherit from it
  - It appears that it's somewhat easy to run out of COOKIE space when using a model object in the SESSIONS object
    - Might want to store a user_id instead, would have other implications though...
  - Can I condense applications show page into conditional position show page for users?
    - Should I only send instance objects into view which are already authorized? I think so
  - Should the Application model "has_one" Interview?


GENERAL Thoughts
- You were totally right about views not having any instance or class methods... View shouldn't interact with model because a programmer could change the information being displayed
  - Should I use any conditionals based on controller-sent booleans in view files?
- Views should use instance variables sent by controllers and display best way possible
- Controllers form the information to be sent most efficiently by interacting with model
- If sending an model object should all the activerecord associations be considered fair game?
  - YES DON'T SEND ANY MODEL OBJECTS BECAUSE TO SHOW THEM YOU HAVE TO INTERACT WITH THE MODEL LULZ

- Look into how the send_file method works. How can i break it?  What happens when I do?
- Have new position form filled out when returning from adding a new company
- How to have instance variables available across some but not all routes and still keep it DRY?
- Have an applicant name their resume
- Javascript type stuff would be to make content appear upon click of a button?
- How does a user know if they've successfully registered?
  - SHould it log them in and take them to their user show page?
- Want recruiters to be associated with only their companies on list a position
- List positions and show which are posted by user (recruiter) and order as such

- Working through being able to view applicant/recruiter profile if have an interview in common
- Caught a bug earlier.. What was it? Oh, it was trying to schedule an interview as a recruiter, something like the application already exists
  - It might be a bad idea to check if application.interview.nil? in positions SHOW page because there might already be an interview with that application_id

* New resume crashes app if no resume is chosen

- Notes from Avner:
  - Use associations instead of model methods whenever possible (way too many model methods)
  - login and logout routes aren't RESTful
  - Save hashed_password to database and have actual password as virtual attribute
  - Have authorized? method as a helper method
  - Don't have any .where methods or similar in VIEWS
  - It's OK to have simple conditional statements in VIEWS (such as if @authorized_applicant)
