- If you delete yourself, either as a recruiter or an applicant, what happens to the dependent database entries?
    * Does it make sense to delete them right away?
    * Currently it crashes the program because the ActiveRecord associations are broken
- Authorizations... authorizations everywhere
- And authentications! (for applicants and recruiters)
- File upload capabilities
- Ability to scan a document for a name?  Would have to parse through the .PDF and search for common first/last names
- If you go to the hiring page from the looking page already logged in, should it automatically logout?
    * If so, should it display a message saying  as such?


- Refactor Stuff
  - full_name virtual attributes for applicants and recruiters

- Look into how the send_file method works. How can i break it?  What happens when I do?
- Verify password upon registration with second field
- Have new position form filled out when returning from adding a new company
- How to have instance variables available across some but not all routes and still keep it DRY?
- Have an applicant name their resume
- Javascript type stuff would be to make content appear upon click of a button?

TO DO TODAY
- View Applications button from position show page is broken, let's fix that
  - Appears to be a bug with something that can happen with the URL and params hash, might have fixed it...
- Applications by position are showing some from another position
  - Let's fix this by moving the route from applications controller to the positions controller and list applications below position in show
  - Along the way, let's move the redirect from a successful resume upload to show resume page, then from there have a link to go to position index page
    - INSTEAD let's redirect to the applicant's show page and have the resumes listed below
    - Update the nav links to have a show user profile link (show routes for applicants and recruiters)
      - Need security for this, can we check the params :id value in the route against the session[:user] id? I think so.
        - IN FACT THIS COULD SOLVE ALL THE WEIRD STUFF WITH MAKING A NEW PARAMS VALUE FOR THE SPECIFIC ID, e.g. WE SHOULD BE LISTING RESUMES BY APPLICANT ON APPLICANT SHOW PAGE
