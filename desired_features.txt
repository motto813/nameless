- If you delete yourself, either as a recruiter or an applicant, what happens to the dependent database entries?
    * Does it make sense to delete them right away?
    * Currently it crashes the program because the ActiveRecord associations are broken
- Ability to scan a document for a name?  Would have to parse through the .PDF and search for common first/last names
- If you go to the hiring page from the looking page already logged in, should it automatically logout?
    * If so, should it display a message saying  as such?


- Refactor Stuff
  - full_name virtual attributes for applicants and recruiters
  - authorized? class methods are class agnostic for users...
  - THere should be NO instance or class methods in a VIEW file

- Look into how the send_file method works. How can i break it?  What happens when I do?
- Verify password upon registration with second field
- Have new position form filled out when returning from adding a new company
- How to have instance variables available across some but not all routes and still keep it DRY?
- Have an applicant name their resume
- Javascript type stuff would be to make content appear upon click of a button?
- How does a user know if they've successfully registered?
  - SHould it log them in and take them to their user show page?
- Want recruiters to be associated with only their companies on list a position
- List positions and show which are posted by user (recruiter) and order as such
- Applicants shouldn't be able to see pending applications on position show page

TO DO TODAY
- View Applications button from position show page is broken, let's fix that
  - Appears to be a bug with something that can happen with the URL and params hash, might have fixed it...
- Need security for authorization, can we check the params :id value in the route against the session[:user] id? I think so.
  - Currently doing this inside specific route, the authorized applicant and recruiter variables that are saved in the before route methods aren't working yet

07/12/17
- Only list pending applications for recruiter
  - Make an authorized user class method for applicant and recruiter models
- My position lists only have company name and title
- SCHEDULED FOR INTERVIEW column in applications table
  - Perhaps a new interviews table? I think so
      - Join between applications, applicants, and recruiters?
  - IF application is scheduled for interview, recruiter can view applicant profile
